This Java program serves as a hotel management system designed to handle various hotel operations. The code is structured with object-oriented principles, featuring classes like Food, SingleRoom, DoubleRoom, and custom exception classes. It facilitates the booking and management of different types of rooms, including single and double rooms, while also enabling users to order food. The Hotel class manages critical functionalities such as displaying room details, checking availability, booking rooms, generating bills, and ordering food. The program incorporates file I/O for data persistence, saving hotel details to a backup file. It also implements multithreading with the Write class to asynchronously write hotel details to the backup file, ensuring data integrity. Overall, the system provides users with an interactive console-based interface to perform hotel-related tasks, making it a basic yet functional hotel management solution.
